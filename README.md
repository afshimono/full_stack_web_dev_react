# full_stack_web_dev_react

Full Stack Web Dev with React Specialization from Coursera
Divided in 4 main modules, which will be updated and completed as the course progresses.

- Bootstrap4
- React
- React Native
- NodeJS

**You will need nodejs and npm installed to run all those projects. They work with Yarn as well.**

# Bootstrap4

Project folder is Boostrap/conFusion.

# React

Project folder is React/confusion.

You will need to install json-server globally via npm to get the project working properly. You can do so by typing:
`npm install -g json-server`

You will need to open a new terminal, navigate to the folder React/json-server, and start the server on a specific port to avoid conflict with the port we are using for lite-server:
`json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000`
Notice we are specifing port 3001 and a delay of 2 seconds (2000 miliseconds) to emulate real case scenario.

# NodeJS

Project folder is NodeJS/conFusionServer
